### kotlin mapper

The goal would be reaching something like mapstruct[1] with custom mapping mechanism. I've seen the kotlin example what they made[2] but I don't like the idea to create extra constructors with null parameters because I think this kills the most important feature of Kotlin. I'm searching a more idiomatic way to achieve the same mapping mechanism.
